#+TITLE: Borgmarks - Merlin Corey at Github dot I/O
* Borgmarks
Bookmarks in emacs org-mode.

Curated, categorized, and tagged by hand.
* Theory of organization
** Categorization through headings
   - Top-level headings represent broad categories of related links.
   - Tagging is used for exposing topics related to a particular link.
** Subcategorization through subheadings
   - Subheadings are used to represent narrower subcategories within a particular category.
   - Subheadings *must* come *after* the sibling links.
** Tags for metadata
   - Tags should be single words so they can be categorized automatically without a full NLP engine
   - Tags should include the publish year and last update year if available
** Master list vs Category pages
   Currently there is only a single page master list, but it is getting very large to manage and read.
*** Roadmap
   In the future we will want to have tag, category, and potentially even subcategory pages.

   This will mean either compiling those pages from the master list, or compiling the master list from those pages.
   Compiling the master list from the categories and subcategories seems most appropriate.
*** History
    Originally, Borgmarks was a single =index.org= file with some example =elisp= code.
** Theory of operation
   - Links should be their own headings followed by tags.
   - Optional properties with CREATED date.
   - Description.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The documentation and code quality is all good.

The implementation choices leave some things to be desired.
The Queue and Stack implementations are Linked Lists instead of array backed, the hash table is closed instead of (the only barely more complicated) open Robin hood hash table scheme, the union-find/disjoint-set implementation doesn't have path compression or rank unions.

Overall very good, but it could be Great (tm) with just a little bit of work.

> I thought array-based queues resulted in O(n) queue/dequeue.

Not necessarily. A circular buffer[1] can be used as a queue with O(1) queue/dequeue. C++ implementations (gcc?), IIRC, uses an interesting array-of-arrays approach; it also has O(1) queue/dequeue. I'm not sure why the array-of-arrays approach is better than a circular buffer, though.

Array based designs can result is less allocations, and maybe less overhead. For example, if you have a circular buffer with space for 16 items, it only needs to allocate space if you need more room, whereas a linked list queue would allocate for each and every item placed into it. Linked lists also require space for the pointer to the next link, for each link in the list. (And, if you keep them, back pointers, though these aren't necessary for just a queue.) Arrays might have some unused slack space, however.

#+END_QUOTE

#+CAPTION: jayd16 opines
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Resizing a fully contiguous circle buffer would cause a copy every element as well forcing you to make a single contiguous memory section.
Array of arrays just needs to resize the top level array.
#+END_QUOTE

#+CAPTION: manwe150 sublimes
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But the copy only has to move n items, but was constructed with m items, where n < m (and usually n << m).
Where n is the max size of the queue and m is the total number of items that will ever be enqueued.

On the other hand, an array of arrays (no recursion) doesn’t change the big-O complexity cost, just the constant multiplier.
That should definitely improve performance of the uncommon operation (the copy), but hypothetically might slow down the actual queuing operations (and drastically reduce throughout)

But maybe you meant the array of arrays to be recursive? That seems like it would alter the big-O (from n+m to log(n)+m).
But typically m>>n, so the net result is the same.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
The underlying idea of this project is abstraction.
Rather than develop a Tetris game in Life directly, we slowly ratcheted up the abstraction in a series of steps.
At each layer, we get further away from the difficulties of Life and closer to the construction of a computer that is as easy to program as any other.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
From here we developed an architecture for our processor.
We spent significant effort on designing an architecture that was both as non-esoteric and as easily-implementable as possible.
Whereas the Wireworld computer used a rudimentary transport-triggered architecture, this project uses a much more flexible RISC architecture complete with multiple opcodes and addressing modes.
We created an assembly language, known as QFTASM (Quest for Tetris Assembly), which guided the construction of our processor.

   In a typical build system, the dependency arrows go down.
   Although this is the way they would naturally go due to gravity, it is unfortunately also where the enemy's gate is.
   This makes it very inefficient and unfriendly.
   In tup, the arrows go up.
   This is obviously true because it rhymes.

The whole point of both of these options is to give the optimiser less leeway than it normally has.
Therefore, unless you encounter a bug in the optimiser, the fastest should be to use neither, where the optimiser assumes your code doesn't have any overflows and doesn't emit code to handle overflows.

> What what does it mean when the =-ftrapv= definition says it generates "traps?" Does this mean exceptions?

It doesn't mean a C++ exception.
It's target-dependent, but assuming x86, it means the GCC runtime libraries cause =SIGABRT= to be raised that will normally abort your program.
On other platforms, it might use special CPU instructions that cause a hardware exception.
It's mainly useful for debugging purposes and perhaps in a few cases for safety, where the risk of continuing after overflow is greater than the risk of the program suddenly terminating.

#+CAPTION:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Former Carnegie Mellon University professor Yuji Ijiri, founder of the transitional momentum accounting practice, also known as triple-entry accounting, died on Jan. 18. He was 81.

Born Feb. 24, 1935, educated and employed as an accountant in his native Japan, Ijiri later adopted the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA), now the Tepper School of Business, and Carnegie Mellon University as his workplace and home for the final half-century of his life. He earned a Ph.D. in industrial administration at Carnegie Mellon in 1963 and, after four years at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, joined the faculty of GSIA. He remained a central Carnegie Mellon figure from 1967 until his death.

Until his retirement in 2011, Ijiri was the R.M. Trueblood University Professor of Accounting and Economics, emeritus. During his time in this position he collaborated and taught alongside such notables as Nobel laureate Herb Simon, former university president Richard Cyert, global operations and accounting visionary Bill Cooper, Ijiri’s thesis adviser James March, political scientist and co-author of the Behavioral Theory of the Firm, and global economics expert and Federal Reserve historian Allan Meltzer.

“Yuji played an instrumental role in the history of the Tepper School and is considered one of the intellectual giants of his era,” said Robert Dammon, dean of the Tepper School and professor of financial economics, who remembers his own 1984 arrival at the school, meeting the luminaries such as Simon and Ijiri. “Throughout his career, Yuji was an intellectual leader who had tremendous impact on the field of accounting, his colleagues, and the legions of Ph.D. students he worked with over the years. His influence and contributions have left an enduring legacy of research productivity and impact that sets one of the highest standards for academic achievement.”

Ijiri was named to the Accounting Hall of Fame in 1989, an honor afforded just 94 people through its 67-year history at Ohio State University. He authored 200 published papers and 25 books, some translated into Spanish, French and Japanese, but none more important to him than his 1989 work about triple-entry accounting. He was among the founding members of the Journal of Accounting and Public Policy in the early 1980s, as well as the only four-time winner of the American Accounting Association (AAA) Notable Contributions to Accounting Lecturer Award: 1966, 1967, 1971 and 1976. Ijiri served the AAA as vice president in the mid-1970s and president in the 1980s.

Ijiri, by his own description a “constant gardener” in education, once said, “Carnegie Mellon has indeed been ‘small gardens’ of learning blessed with exceptional teachers and students. Yet there seems to be something more. The gardens seem to have a special way of letting people grow.”

Ijiri was 6 years old when he attended the Abacus Math School in Kobe, Japan, and by the 10th grade was doing the bookkeeping for his father’s bakery. In 1952, before even graduating from the Nara High School of Commerce, he passed a test that allowed him to take the CPA examination without a college degree. He passed the CPA exam in 1953, while attending Doshisha Junior College at night. He finished three years at Ritsumeikan University, also in Kyoto, with a bachelor’s of law degree. Thus, he had completed all requirements for a CPA certificate at age 21, the youngest on record in Japan.

He worked at a small accounting firm and then with Price Waterhouse & Co. before leaving in 1959 to attend graduate school at the University of Minnesota, where he received a master’s degree in 1960. From there, he attended Carnegie Mellon, where he remained except for four years at Stanford.

Ijiri also was recognized internationally in accounting for aggregation theory, firm size distributions, accounting measurement theory, computer languages, and quantitative models in business and economics. Fair value accounting in the early 2000s brought his concepts to the forefront again, and among his final papers were works exploring connections between triple-entry accounting and quantum physics and quantum computing. At Carnegie Mellon, his service included academic councils, dean policy advisory and more. He was awarded the Weil Prize for faculty research in 2009-10. Established in 1990, the Yuji Ijiri Award for Excellence in Accounting is awarded to an MBA student during the school’s diploma ceremony each year.

Surviving are his wife of 54 years, Tomoko, of Oberlin, Ohio; and two daughters, Yumi (Oberlin, Ohio) and Lisa (Boston, Massachusetts).

#+CAPTION: Nathan Bronson discussed tradeoffs between SwissTable and F14
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
From a performance perspective the main design difference between SwissTable and F14 is whether the metadata and data are separated (as in SwissTable) or colocated (as in F14).
I would expect colocation to work better when the entries are small, and separation to work better the elements are large.
F14 also pushes users toward a third storage strategy, F14VectorSet, for medium and large values.
This stores elements in a contiguous array and puts a 4-byte index into the main hash table, which makes lookup slower but iteration (and hence destruction) faster.
This indirect strategy also saves memory, because the vector effectively has a perfect load factor.

    - Try using color or font weight to do the same job to differentiate importantness
    - Stay away from font weights under 400 for UI work

    1. Reduce the opacity of white text
    2. Hand-pick a color that's base don the background color
***  Offset your shadows

*** Use fewer borders
    1. Use a box shadow

1. CSS and HTML are extremely resilient, they ignore your typos and unsupported features gracefully and never crash, so just daring to use them in your code, no need for exception handling comparing to JS, in that sense, if you can do it in CSS, avoid JS.

2. Leverage CSS override

3. Use browser devtools to test all browsers. No need install all older browser to check CSS. icanuse helps greatly too.

4. Use feature-queries for CSS.

These indeed can make your CSS code work for both the stone age and hottest browsers, all at the same time, without much hacking. Great videos.

*** Conclusion
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In this article I set out to answer some of the most common questions on sine and cosine, or trigonometry in general.
I could give you a more mathematical explanation of sine and cosine, but I wanted this article to be of practical use to game programmers, especially to Allegro game programmers, not to give an encyclopedic description of abstract mathematics.
I hope that this has been of some use to you, my dear reader.
Please send me an e-mail if you have something to say about this article, whether you like it, dislike it, find it useful, or just want to say hi.
If you have any questions you can ask them on the forums at http://www.allegro.cc.
It is very likely that I'll see it there.
And if you ever write an effect in a demo or game using the explanations in this article, I would very much like to see the result.

** [[https://jaycarlson.net/microcontrollers/][The Amazing $1 Microcontroller]]

   Exploration of 21 different microcontrollers each costing less than $1 to help familiarize oneself with all the major ecosystems out there.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
While some projects that come across my desk are complex enough to require a hundreds-of-MHz microcontroller with all the bells and whistles, it’s amazing how many projects work great using nothing more than a $1 chip — so this is the only rule I established for the shoot-out. 1

I wanted to explore the $1 pricing zone specifically because it’s the least amount of money you can spend on an MCU that’s still general-purpose enough to be widely useful in a diverse array of projects.

Any cheaper, and you end up with 6- or 8-pin parts with only a few dozen bytes of RAM, no ADC, nor any peripherals other than a single timer and some GPIO.

Any more expensive, and the field completely opens up to an overwhelming number of parts — all with heavily-specialized peripherals and connectivity options.

These MCUs were selected to represent their entire families — or sub-families, depending on the architecture — and in my analysis, I’ll offer some information about the family as a whole.

If you want to scroll down and find out who the winner is, don’t bother — there’s really no sense in trying to declare the “king of $1 MCUs” as everyone knows the best microcontroller is the one that best matches your application needs. I mean, everyone knows the best microcontroller is the one you already know how to use. No, wait — the best microcontroller is definitely the one that is easiest to prototype with. Or maybe that has the lowest impact on BOM pricing?

I can’t even decide on the criteria for the best microcontroller — let alone crown a winner.

What I will do, however, is offer a ton of different recommendations for different users at the end. Read on!

**** Importance of Via
#+CAPTION: buro9 on via
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Via is not safe to remove and Fastly know this as well as Akamai, Cloudflare and others.

A very cheap attack is to chain CDNs into a nice circle. This is what Via protects against: https://blog.cloudflare.com/preventing-malicious-request-loops/

Just because a browser doesn't use a header does not make the header superfluous.
#+END_QUOTE
**** Expires tricks
#+CAPTION: justinsaccount on expires
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

cache-control doesn't completely replace Expires for some use cases.

If you have a scheduled task that generates data every hour, you can set Expires accordingly so all clients will refresh the data as soon as the hour rolls over.

You can do this using max-age but then you have to dynamically calculate this header per request which means you can't do things like upload your data to s3 and set the cache-control header on it.

With expires, I can upload a file to s3 and set

    Expires: ... 17:00

and then not have to touch it again for an hour.

you can work around this client side with per hour filenames or the other usual cache busting tricks, but that's annoying.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
First, let me clear up a few misconceptions from the previous answers.
One of them said “Try writing an operating system with Lisp”, as though this would be somehow harder.
In fact, one of the nicest operating systems ever done was on “The Lisp Machines” (in Zeta-Lisp), the hardware and software following the lead of “The Parc Machines” and Smalltalk — and we in turn had been very influenced by the Lisp model of programming and implementation.
(These operating systems in both Smalltalk and Lisp were both better (claim) and easier to write (simpler to demonstrate) than the standard ones of today.)

Another interesting answer assumed that “the test of time” is somehow a cosmic optimization.
But as every biologist knows, Darwinian processes “find fits” to an environment, and if the environment is lacking, then the fits will be lacking.
Similarly, if most computer people lack understanding and knowledge, then what they will select will also be lacking.
There is abundant evidence today that this is just what has happened.

But neither of these has anything to do with my praise of Lisp (and I did explain what I meant in more detail in “The Early History of Smalltalk”).

To start with an analogy, let’s notice that a person who has learned calculus fluently can in many areas out-think the greatest geniuses in history.
Scientists after Newton were qualitatively more able than before, etc.
My slogan for this is “Point of view is worth 80 IQ points” (you can use “context” or “perspective” etc.).
A poor one might subtract 80 IQ points! (See above).
A new more powerful one makes some thinking possible that was too difficult before.

One of our many problems with thinking is “cognitive load”: the number of things we can pay attention to at once.
The cliche is 7±2, but for many things it is even less.
We make progress by making those few things be more powerful.

This is one of the reasons mathematicians like compact notation.
The downside is the extra layers of abstraction and new cryptic things to learn — this is the practice part of violin playing — but once you can do this, what you can think about at once has been vastly magnified.
There were 20 Maxwell’s Equations in their original form (in terms of partial differentials and cartesian coordinates).
Today the four equations we can think about all at once are primarily due to their reformulation by Heaviside to emphasize what is really important about them (and what is likely to be problematic — e.g.
the electric and magnetic fields should probably be symmetric with respect to movement, etc).

Modern science is about experiencing phenomena and devising models whose relationships with the phenomena can be “negotiated”.
The “negotiation” is necessary because what’s inside our heads, and our representations systems etc have no necessary connection to “what’s out there?”.

Taking this point of view, we can see there can be a “bridge science” and “bridge scientists” because engineers build bridges and these furnish phenomena for scientists to make models of.

Similarly, there can be a “computer science” and “computer scientists” because engineers build hardware and software and these furnish phenomena for scientists to make models of.
(In fact, this was a large part of what was meant by “computer science” in the early 60s — and it was an aspiration — still is — not an accomplished fact).

The story behind Lisp is fun (you can read John McCarthy’s account in the first History of Programming Languages).
One of the motivations was that he wanted something like “Mathematical Physics” — he called it a “Mathematical Theory of Computation”.
Another was that he needed a very general kind of language to make a user interface AI — called “The Advice Taker” — that he had thought up in the late 50s.

He could program — most programs were then in machine code, Fortran existed, and there was a language that had linked lists.

John made something that could do what any programming language could do (relatively easy), but did it in such a way so that it could express the essence of what it was about (this was the math part or the meta part or the modern Maxwell’s Equations part, however you might like to think of it).
He partly did this — he says — to show that this way to do things was “neater than a Turing Machine”.

Another observation about this is that the “slope” from the simplest machine structures to the highest level language was the steepest ever — meaning that the journey from recognizable hardware to cosmic expression is a rocket jump!

As is often the case — especially in engineering — a great scientific model is often superior to what exists, and can lead to much better artifacts.
This was certainly true here.
Steve Russell (later famous for being the main inventor and programmer of “SpaceWar”) looked at what John had done, and said: “That’s a program.
If I coded it up we’d have a running version”.
As John remarked: “He did, and we did”!

The result was “unlimited programming in an eyeful” (the bottom half of page 13 in the Lisp 1.5 manual).
The key was not so much “Lisp” but the kinds of thinking that this kind of representational approach allowed and opened up regarding all kinds of programming language schemes.

A fun thing about it this is that once you’ve grokked it, you can think right away of better programming languages than Lisp, and you can think right away of better ways to write the meta descriptions than John did.
This is the “POV = 80 IQ points” part.

But this is like saying that once you’ve seen Newton, it becomes possible to do electrodynamics and relativity.
The biggest feat in science was Newton’s!

This is why “Lisp is the greatest!”

There's singles of us!

If you want to extract it run M-x org-babel-tangle and you will end up with the usual source files and directories installed relative to the location of the org file.

I doubt there's a dozen people in the world that do it. But it is surprisingly useful and powerful when you get used to it. If anyone in Melbourne is interested in learning about this I have been toying with the idea of running a workshop on it.

I'm in the process of getting the detangle working for noweb mode. The current implementation fakes it with regex which force you to write code linearly instead of literately. But even if you can't detangle arbitrarily nested code it's magic to see changes in a source file appear in the right source code block.

#+CAPTION: Linus' response summary
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
With separate signatures (ie the "git tag -s" model), you can ask the
people who signed the original repository to consider re-signing the
rewritten one. See? Safe, flexible, and much superior.

The exact same thing goes for keys that get invalidated because they ended
up being shown to be too weak or just flawed some other way, btw. That is
a reason to re-sign, _without_ the repository necessarily changing.

You can do _none_ of these things sanely if you put the signatures into
the commits themselves.

So don't do it.

Btw, there's a final reason, and probably the really real one. Signing
each commit is totally stupid. It just means that you automate it, and you
make the signature worth less. It also doesn't add any real value, since
the way the git DAG-chain of SHA1's work, you only ever need _one_
signature to make all the commits reachable from that one be effectively
covered by that one. So signing each commit is simply missing the point.

IOW, you don't _ever_ have a reason to sign anythign but the "tip". The
only exception is the "go back and re-sign", but that's the one that
requires external signatures anyway.

So be happy with 'git tag -s'. It really is the right way.

#+CAPTION: Explanation of Mutation Testing
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mutation Testing is a type of software testing where we mutate (change) certain statements in the source code and check if the test cases are able to find the errors.
It is a type of White Box Testing which is mainly used for Unit Testing.
The changes in mutant program are kept extremely small, so it does not affect the overall objective of the program.

The goal of Mutation Testing is to assess the quality of the test cases which should be robust enough to fail mutant code.
This method is also called as Fault based testing strategy as it involves creating fault in the program

Mutation was originally proposed in 1971 but lost fervor due to high costs involved.
Now, again it has picked steam and is widely used for languages such as Java and XML.
#+END_QUOTE
*** [[https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46584][State of Mutation Testing at Google]] :paper:software:engineering:testing:2018:
#+CAPTION: Abstract of the paper
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mutation testing assesses test suite efficacy by inserting small faults into programs and measuring the ability of the test suite to detect them.
It is widely considered the strongest test criterion in terms of finding the most faults and it subsumes a number of other coverage criteria.
Traditional mutation analysis is computationally prohibitive which hinders its adoption as an industry standard.
In order to alleviate the computational issues, we present a diff-based probabilistic approach to mutation analysis that drastically reduces the number of mutants by omitting lines of code without statement coverage and lines that are determined to be uninteresting - we dub these arid lines.
Furthermore, by reducing the number of mutants and carefully selecting only the most interesting ones we make it easier for humans to understand and evaluate the result of mutation analysis.
We propose a heuristic for judging whether a node is arid or not, conditioned on the programming language.
We focus on a code-review based approach and consider the effects of surfacing mutation results on developer attention.
The described system is used by 6,000 engineers in Google on all code changes they author or review, affecting in total more than 14,000 code authors as part of the mandatory code review process.
The system processes about 30% of all diffs across Google that have statement coverage calculated.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“Matchers” or “ranges” (even the terminology is split up thanks to the lack of a spec!) are not defined in semver.
It only defines how to version a particular software artifact, it cannot answer the question “does version 1.2.3 fit the constraint > 1.0.0?”

Does that make sense? The “> 1.0.0” part is undefined. That includes things like “is that space required there?”, and so is an interoperabilty issue.

#+CAPTION: baseethrowaway comments on their setup
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One can make a passive build much more powerful.

NSG S0, once out, will most likely be the go-to case for such setups.
Until then, an HDPLEX H5 is cool.

My desk has a H5 on it, housing an i7 8700 (non-K) and a GTX 1060.
The TIM under the heatspreader is replaced with Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut and Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut is used as every other TIM that the case setup needs.
The CPU is on stock clocks with a voltage offset of -30 mV.
The GPU has the power target reduced to 90% and clocks increased by 130 MHz, so that it is effectively undervolted as well.
The PSU is a Seasonic Ultra Prime Titanium 650.
Prime95 with AVX throttles really, really fast, under a minute, perhaps, but is a very unrealistic load.
Non-AVX stress tests and FurMark take a while to start throttling (20 minutes?), as the thermal capacity of the aluminum case is quite big.
After hours of gaming, the GPU and CPU float around 80 C while providing full stock performance.
I don't do 3D rendering (other than in-game) or video en/decoding, so have not had long, real-world, full loads to see how temperatures behave with those.

From the discussion I've had and forums I've read, I think that people are afraid of putting more power in passive cases and having their components at "high" temperatures, despite those being rated for them.

#+CAPTION: Joel's answer from 2011
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is such a common question here and elsewhere that I will attempt to write the world’s most canonical answer to this question. Hopefully in the future when someone on answers.onstartups asks how to split up the ownership of their new company, you can simply point to this answer.

The most important principle: Fairness, and the perception of fairness, is much more valuable than owning a large stake. Almost everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong, and one of the biggest things that can go wrong is huge, angry, shouting matches between the founders as to who worked harder, who owns more, whose idea was it anyway, etc. That is why I would always rather split a new company 50-50 with a friend than insist on owning 60% because “it was my idea,” or because “I was more experienced” or anything else. Why? Because if I split the company 60-40, the company is going to fail when we argue ourselves to death. And if you just say, “to heck with it, we can NEVER figure out what the correct split is, so let’s just be pals and go 50-50,” you’ll stay friends and the company will survive.

Thus, I present you with Joel’s Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup.

For simplicity sake, I’m going to start by assuming that you are not going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside investors. Later, I’ll explain how to deal with venture capital, but for now assume no investors.

Also for simplicity sake, let’s temporarily assume that the founders all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at the same time. Later, I’ll explain how to deal with founders who do not start at the same time.

Here’s the principle. As your company grows, you tend to add people in “layers”.

1. The top layer is the first founder or founders. There may be 1, 2, 3, or more of you, but you all start working about the same time, and you all take the same risk… quitting your jobs to go work for a new and unproven company.
2. The second layer is the first real employees. By the time you hire this layer, you’ve got cash coming in from somewhere (investors or customers–doesn’t matter). These people didn’t take as much risk because they got a salary from day one, and honestly, they didn’t start the company, they joined it as a job.
3. The third layer are later employees. By the time they joined the company, it was going pretty well.

For many companies, each “layer” will be approximately one year long. By the time your company is big enough to sell to Google or go public or whatever, you probably have about 6 layers: the founders and roughly five layers of employees. Each successive layer is larger. There might be two founders, five early employees in layer 2, 25 employees in layer 3, and 200 employees in layer 4. The later layers took less risk.

OK, now here’s how you use that information:

The founders should end up with about 50% of the company, total. Each of the next five layers should end up with about 10% of the company, split equally among everyone in the layer.

Example:

- Two founders start the company. They each take 2500 shares. There are 5000 shares outstanding, so each founder owns half.
- They hire four employees in year one. These four employees each take 250 shares. There are 6000 shares outstanding.
- They hire another 20 employees in year two. Each one takes 50 shares. They get fewer shares because they took less risk, and they get 50 shares because we’re giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up.
- By the time the company has six layers, you have given out 10,000 shares. Each founder ends up owning 25%. Each employee layer owns 10% collectively. The earliest employees who took the most risk own the most shares.

Make sense? You don’t have to follow this exact formula but the basic idea is that you set up “stripes” of seniority, where the top stripe took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least, and each “stripe” shares an equal number of shares, which magically gives employees more shares for joining early.

A slightly different way to use the stripes is for seniority. Your top stripe is the founders, below that you reserve a whole stripe for the fancy CEO that you recruited who insisted on owning 10%, the stripe below that is for the early employees and also the top managers, etc. However you organize the stripes, it should be simple and clear and easy to understand and not prone to arguments.

Now that we have a fair system set out, there is one important principle. You must have vesting. Preferably 4 or 5 years. Nobody earns their shares until they’ve stayed with the company for a year. A good vesting schedule is 25% in the first year, 2% each additional month. Otherwise your co-founder is going to quit after three weeks and show up, 7 years later, claiming he owns 25% of the company. It never makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting. This is an extremely common mistake and it’s terrible when it happens. You have these companies where 3 cofounders have been working day and night for five years, and then you discover there’s some jerk that quit after two weeks and he still thinks he owns 25% of the company for his two weeks of work.

Now, let me clear up some little things that often complicate the picture.

What happens if you raise an investment? The investment can come from anywhere… an angel, a VC, or someone’s dad. Basically, the answer is simple: the investment just dilutes everyone.

Using the example from above… we’re two founders, we gave ourselves 2500 shares each, so we each own 50%, and now we go to a VC and he offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the company.

1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares. So you make another 2500 shares and give them to the VC. He owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd. That’s all there is to it.

What happens if not all the early employees need to take a salary? A lot of times you have one founder who has a little bit of money saved up, so she decides to go without a salary for a while, while the other founder, who needs the money, takes a salary. It is tempting just to give the founder who went without pay more shares to make up for it. The trouble is that you can never figure out the right amount of shares to give. This is just going to cause conflicts. Don’t resolve these problems with shares. Instead, just keep a ledger of how much you paid each of the founders, and if someone goes without salary, give them an IOU. Later, when you have money, you’ll pay them back in cash. In a few years when the money comes rolling in, or even after the first VC investment, you can pay back each founder so that each founder has taken exactly the same amount of salary from the company.

Shouldn’t I get more equity because it was my idea? No. Ideas are pretty much worthless. It is not worth the arguments it would cause to pay someone in equity for an idea. If one of you had the idea but you both quit your jobs and started working at the same time, you should both get the same amount of equity. Working on the company is what causes value, not thinking up some crazy invention in the shower.

What if one of the founders doesn’t work full time on the company? Then they’re not a founder. In my book nobody who is not working full time counts as a founder. Anyone who holds on to their day job gets a salary or IOUs, but not equity. If they hang onto that day job until the VC puts in funding and then comes to work for the company full time, they didn’t take nearly as much risk and they deserve to receive equity along with the first layer of employees.

What if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods (patents, domain names, etc) to the company? Great. Pay for that in cash or IOUs, not shares. Figure out the right price for that computer they brought with them, or their clever word-processing patent, and give them an IOU to be paid off when you’re doing well. Trying to buy things with equity at this early stage just creates inequality, arguments, and unfairness.

How much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees? That depends on market conditions. Realistically, if the investors end up owning more than 50%, the founders are going to feel like sharecroppers and lose motivation, so good investors don’t get greedy that way. If the company can bootstrap without investors, the founders and employees might end up owning 100% of the company. Interestingly enough, the pressure is pretty strong to keep things balanced between investors and founders/employees; an old rule of thumb was that at IPO time (when you had hired all the employees and raised as much money as you were going to raise) the investors would have 50% and the founders/employees would have 50%, but with hot Internet companies in 2011, investors may end up owning a lot less than 50%.

Conclusion

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, but anything you can do to make it simple, transparent, straightforward, and, above-all, fair, will make your company much more likely to be successful.
